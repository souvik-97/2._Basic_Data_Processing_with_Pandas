    "In this lecture, we're going to talk about querying DataFrames. The first step in the process is to understand \"Boolean Masking\". A Boolean masking is the heart of fast and efficient querying and both NumPy and in Pandas, and it's analogous to \"bit masking\" which is used in other areas of computational science. By the end of this lecture, you'll understand how Boolean masking works and how to apply this to a DataFrame to get out the data that you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a Boolean mask is an array which can be thought of as a one dimension like a series, or two-dimensions like a DataFrame, where each of the values of the array are either true or false. This array is essentially overlaid on top of the other data structure that we're querying, and any cell aligned with the true value will be admitted into our final result, and any cell aligned with the false value will not. \n",
